Choice D
========
 
Notes:

Because everything else is false.

It is difficult to see understand what is meant by the phrase but ForkJoinTask has methods that return results.
>Choice A The ForkJoinTask class can't return a result.


public abstract class ForkJoinTask<V> implements Future<V>, Serializable.
>Choice B The ForkJoinTask is a sub class of RecursiveTask class.


>Choice C The ForkJoinTask class has only the "fork()" and "join()" methods.
